#summary pa.iscde.tasklist.category

= Introduction =

This plugin is used to create a new category. We need to give a tag (in this case, a small word, like "bug"), a name, an image (or icon, which is optional) and a color (this color will appear in UML table, to highlight the method that contains the task, which is optional too).

= Details =

{{{	

public Category(String tag, String name, Image icon, Color color){
		this.tag = tag;
		this.name = name;
		this.icon = icon;
		this.color = color;
}

}}}
